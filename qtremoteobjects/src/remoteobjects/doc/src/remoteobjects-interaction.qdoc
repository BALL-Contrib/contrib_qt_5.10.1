\brief Describes how source/replica interaction works.
\section1 Remote Object Interaction

Source/replica interaction is directional. Property changes and signal emission
happen on the source, and are propagated to all replicas. If a property is
writable, you can call the setter function on a replica. This will be forwarded
to the source, and if a change is made, it will be made on the source and
subsequently forwarded to all replicas. To the replica, it is then an
asynchronous call, with latency before the change takes effect.

Whereas you can emit a signal on a replica, this may have unexpected results and
is discouraged for that reason. It will only trigger slots connected to the
replica itself, no slots connected to the source or other replicas. Like
property setters, slot invocations on a replica are forwarded to the Source to
run.

The behavior above is implemented automatically by QtRO, there is no need to
write any replica implementation code. It will be handled automatically at
runtime for dynamic replicas, or at compile time for repc generated headers.
